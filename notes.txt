The GNVS field in DSDT possibly groups registers for nVidia graphics stuff


ACPI-WMI thing calls
\_SB.PCI0.P0P2.PEGP._DSM calls
\_SB.PCI0.GFX0._DSM (MUID, REVS, SFNC, ARGD)
    (note: arg names come from SSDT table)
    MUID - Buffer containing UUID
    REVS - Integer containing revision ID (specific to UUID)
    SFNC - Integer containing Function index (should start at 1)
    ARGD - Package that contains function-specific arguments

Terminology
- KBC - Keyboard Controller
- EC - Embedded Controller
- GNVS - Global Non-Volatile Storage (guessed)
- PEGP - PCI Express Graphics Port (guessed)

\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.RINF
- \ - Root
- _SB - System Bus
- PCI0 - PCI Bus
- LPCB - Low Pin Count bus, see http://www.intel.com/design/chipsets/industry/lpc.htm
- EC - Embedded Controller (I/O slave, Bus Master)
- RINF - ??? redundancy information signal ???

Documentation on EC fields (also describing device names) with sample ASL:
http://www.baldwin.cx/~phoenix/reference/docs/acpi_impguide.pdf
page 27

Some documentation on the GNVS fields:
http://review.coreboot.org/gitweb?p=coreboot.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/southbridge/intel/sch/acpi/globalnvs.asl



P80D - 32-bit in GNVS, debug port (IO 0x80) value (src: coreboot globalnvs.asl)
P80H - 32-bit in PRT0 which is at address 0x80-0x83 in SystemIO

Method PX8H accepts two arguments:
- arg0: the byte in P80D to be modified, start counting at 0 from the right.
        If the value is not 0x0-0x3 (inclusive), nothing is modified
- arg1: the new 8-bit data to be inserted at position arg0
After the argument processing above, P80D is stored into P80H



\_SB.LID0._LID // line 6870
if \_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.ECOK
    return \_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.LIDS
else
    return 1
According to the acpi spec page 343, non-zero = open lid, zero = closed lid
\_SB.LID0._PSW // DSDT line 6887
    if \_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.ECOK
        Store Arg0 in \_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.LWKE
_PSW 1 = enable device wake capabilities, 0 = disable


It looks like \_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.ECOK checks whether the embedded controller is
available. From my DSDT, ECOK is set to One when calling
\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC._REG 0x3 0x1. According to the spec, _REG is called for
indicating that an OperationRegion is ready (or not)


\_SB.PCI0.GFX0._DSM // line 515

My Clevo B7130 accepts two possible values for MUID.

If there is no match, the below is returned:
    0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x80

If MUID matches:
{ 0xD3, 0x73, 0xD8, 0x7E, 0xD0, 0xC2, 0x4F, 0x4E,
  0xA8, 0x54, 0x0F, 0x13, 0x17, 0xB0, 0x1C, 0x2C }
then One is always returned

===================================================
If MUID matches:
{ 0xF8, 0xD8, 0x86, 0xA4, 0xDA, 0x0B, 0x1B, 0x47,
  0xA7, 0x2B, 0x60, 0x42, 0xA6, 0xB5, 0xBE, 0xE0 }
then

If REVS does not match 0x0100, then the below is returned:
{ 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x80 }
(observation: perhaps it means "invalid argument"?)


My SSDT aliases SFNC (Arg2) as _T_0
If SFNC matches Zero, then it returns:
    { 0x01, 0x00, 0x03, 0x04 }

If SFNC matches 0x11, the if-conditions are skipped and the above
"If there is no match, ..." is applied, meaning that the below is returned:
{ 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x80 }

If SFNC matches 0x10, then
    ARGD (Arg3) is aliased as NVVK
    If ARGD equals 0x564B, then it returns something based on the 32-bit
    register \NVID. If the \NVID register value does not match one of the
    comparisons, the buffer from "If there is no match, ..." is returned:
    { 0x02, 0x00, 0x00, 0x80 }
    Otherwise, a buffer of size 226 (0xE2) or 230 (0xE6) is returned which may
    also be based on \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.SSID

**possible power management stuff ahead**
If SFNC matches 0x1A, then // line 596
    If And(\OEMF, One), then // register OEMF is in field GNVS in SystemMemory
    (I now consider ARGD[n] as the n-th element in buff ARGD (Arg3) with n>=0)
        UPFG = ARGD[1]
        OPCE = ARGD[3]
        if And(UPFG, One) OPD3 = And(OPCE, One) // store right-most bit of OPD3
                                                // in OPCE
        TEMP = { 0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x09 }
        if And(\OEMF, 0x10), then
            if \_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.ECOK // whether the EC is available (ready)
                if And(\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.RINF, 0x02)// XXX what field is it?
                    // not sure what field it is, but it contains 0x2 for me
                    TEMP[0] = 0x19
                else
                    TEMP[0] = One
        else
            TEMP[3] = Zero
        return TEMP
    else
        return { 0x00 } // note, buffer size is 4, so {0x00,0x00,0x00,x00}

Only if OPD3 is non-zero, \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.PEGP._PS3 may shutdown the card

Calls:
**turning the nvidia card off**

    \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.PEGP._DSM {0xF8,0xD8,0x86,0xA4,0xDA,0x0B,0x1B,0x47,0xA7,0x2B,0x60,0x42,0xA6,0xB5,0xBE,0xE0} 0x100 0x1A {1,0,0,3}
    \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.PEGP._PS3

**turning the nvidia card on**

    \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.PEGP._PS0

The _DSM function was also found on the Clevo W150HRM, but LLStarks reported
that the driver did not recognize the device even after _PS0 has been called.

===================================================

When turning off (_PS3):
Zero is written to \_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.FDAT
0xBF is written to \_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.FCMD

When turning on (_PS0):
One  is written to \_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.FDAT
0xBF is written to \_SB.PCI0.LPCB.EC.FCMD 

This is observed for Clevo B7130 which has an ITE 8518 embedded controller
(KBC-ITE IT8502E according to the Mainboard Overview of the B7130 Service
Manual)
It's also observed for the Clevo W150HRM (although it's called through SGOF
(off) and SGON (on).

===================================================

Analysis against Asus UL30VT
The Asus UL30VT has a _DSM method that turns devices on/off.

The UUID is different too:
0xA0,0xA0,0x95,0x9D,0x60,0x00,0x48,0x4D,0xB3,0x4D,0x7E,0x5F,0xEA,0x12,0x9F,0xD4

The SFNC is different too: 0x03 instead of 0x1A

The revision number (second argument, Arg1) is ignored.

ARGD is read as a little-endian number and stored in Local0
If it equals 1 (ARGD={0x1,0x0,0x0,0x0}, the device is turned on and One is
returned.
If it equals 2 (ARGD={0x2,0x0,0x0,0x0}, the device is turned off and Zero is
returned.
Otherwise, the status is returned (result of calling \_SB.PCI0.P0P1.VGA._STA)

\_SB.PCI0.P0P1.VGA._STA
If all bits in \_SB.PCI0.REG0 equals to 1, Zero is returned. Otherwise, 0x0F is
returned. REG0 is a 32-bit field in HOSG which is a field in the PCI_Config
space, starting at address Zero.

The same function was found on Clevo W150HRM which expects the same arguments
and returns the same values. 0x00 means that the device is off, 0x0F means that
it's on.

===================================================

The Dell Vostro 3500 has the same _DSM layout as the Asus UL30VT (see above)
and uses the same UUID and SFNC,
The SSDT2.dsl file contains syntax errors on the P8XH function though which
makes analysis a bit harder). Again, Arg3 is converted to an Integer (little
endian of course, stored in Local0). In this case, the last two bits are
significant (AND (Local0, 0x3)). Values for Local0:

- 0 - calls \_SB.PCI0.P0P1.PEGP._STA
- 1 - calls \_SB.PCI0.P0P1.PEGP._ON
- 2 - calls \_SB.PCI0.P0P1.PEGP._OFF

The 1-bit field PO36 is One if the device is disabled and Zero if enabled

Buffer TMP2 contains four Zeros: {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00}. The first byte is
aliased to STS2. If \_SB.PCI0.P0P1.PEGP.PO36 equals Zero, the right-most bit of
STS2 is set to One (Or (STS2, One)).

The return result of \_SB.PCI0.GFX0._DSM for Arg2 = 3 is buffer TMP2. More
precisely, if the device is enabled, the return result is {0x1,0x0,0x0,0x0}. If
the device is disabled, the result is {0x0,0x0,0x0,0x0}

ACPI call for disable card:

    \_SB.PCI0.P0P1.PEGP._DSM {0xA0,0xA0,0x95,0x9D,0x60,0x00,0x48,0x4D,0xB3,0x4D,0x7E,0x5F,0xEA,0x12,0x9F,0xD4} 0x102 0x3 {2,0,0,0}

ACPI call for enable card:

    \_SB.PCI0.P0P1.PEGP._DSM {0xA0,0xA0,0x95,0x9D,0x60,0x00,0x48,0x4D,0xB3,0x4D,0x7E,0x5F,0xEA,0x12,0x9F,0xD4} 0x102 0x3 {1,0,0,0}

The above calls should theoretically work, but it didn't. vga_switcheroo works
here (reported by Samsagax)

===================================================

Short analysis for Asus Aspire 5742G (not tested, theoretical analysis).
The 1-bit field GP36 is Zero if disabled. _PS0 only disabled the card if GP36
is Zero. _PS3 only disables the card if OMPR is 0x03. OMPR can be set using
_DSM.

Arg3 for _DSM:

- if function is 0x1B, indices 0, 1, 2, 3 are used to construct Local0
- if function is 0x10, Arg3 is passed to \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.VGA.GOBT
- if function is 0x1A, the first two bits of index 3 is used for OPCE which
  will be written to OMPR if the first bit of index Zero (name: FLCH) equals 1

So, since OMPR should be 0x3 (binary 11) and OPCE is only written to OMPR if
OPCE is not equal to OMPR and FLCH is 1, Arg3 should be: {0x1,0x0,0x0,0x3}

Possible call for disabling the card:

    \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.VGA._DSM {0xF8,0xD8,0x86,0xA4,0xDA,0x0B,0x1B,0x47,0xA7,0x2B,0x60,0x42,0xA6,0xB5,0xBE,0xE0} 0x100 0x1A {1,0,0,3}
    \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.VGA._PS3
Possible call for enabling the card:

    \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.VGA._PS0

===================================================

The UUID
0xF8,0xD8,0x86,0xA4,0xDA,0x0B,0x1B,0x47,0xA7,0x2B,0x60,0x42,0xA6,0xB5,0xBE,0xE0
was found for:

- Clevo B7130 (works, see above)
- Asus Aspire 5742G (see above, same _DSM params as Clevo B7130)

Windows Instrumentation: WMI and ACPI, sample ASL code
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463463#E6OAC

Devices with _HID PNP0C14 (case-insensitive) are used for WMI.
ACPI methods (xx is object ID):

- _WDG - returns a buffer containing a mapping for data blocks, events and WMI
         methods. See also http://lwn.net/Articles/391230/ and below
- WQxx - returns a data block, optional arg0 for index (if multiple instances)
- WSxx - Set the data block, arg0 is index, arg1 is data
- WMxx - arg0 is instance index to be executed, arg1 method ID and arg2 a
         buffer containing input for the method call
- WExx - optional method that should be supported if keeping an event incurs
         significant overhead. If arg0 is 0, disable event, otherwise enable
- WCxx - optional method that should be supported if collecting data incurs
         significant overhead. If arg0 is 0, disable data block collection, 0
         otherwise
- _WED - results are passed as part of WMI event information, this allows data
         to be included with an event. Arg0 is notification code that caused
         the notification to occur

_WDG
A multiple of 16 + 2 + 1 + 1 (=20) bytes:
- first 14 bytes: GUID for the WMI method
- 15: notification value (used for ACPI Notify)
- 16: Reserved
- 17-18: Object ID. This is appended to the string "WM" to get the ACPI method
         example: 0x42 0x42 are ASCII values for BB, so the method becomes WMBB
- 19: Instance count (??)
- 20: Flags (taken from iksaif's wmidump.c and the msdn link above):
    0x1: ACPI_WMI_EXPENSIVE - run when the first data consumer is interested in
         collecting the data block and run when the last data consumer is not
         interested anymore
    0x2: ACPI_WMI_METHOD - is a method, not a data block
    0x4: ACPI_WMI_STRING - is a Unicode string
    0x8: ACPI_WMI_EVENT - is an event, not a data block or method


WMMX
This was found on both a Clevo B7130 and W150HRM
- arg0: ignored
- arg1: if equals 0x1C, return result of _DSM method, otherwise return 0
- arg2: FUNC + MUID + REVI + SFNC + ARGD
    - FUNC: if 32-bit field matches 0x4D53445F, the _DSM is performed with
            given arguments MUID, REVI, SFNC and ARGD (see beginning)
